            <div layout="row">
                <p>
                    ReFigure was envisioned by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/girija-goyal-01b5781b" target="_blank">Girija Goyal</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesjakin" target="_blank">James Akin</a>
                    to address an unmet need in scientific communication and early career scientists-making
                    every experiment and every figure an actionable, creditable finding without losing the context that comes with the traditional story-telling of full length publications.

            <h3>What research do we host?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A VISUAL metapublication (see example <a href="/blog/item/ab6d23e0-4492-11e7-83fb-c5a41c874d5b" target="_blank">here</a>) linking previously published or new figures from
                    traditional full length papers or single figure publications to assess reproducibility, identify novel findings and catalyze collaborations</li>
                <li>Authors can be early career researchers who create such metapublications in the course of their reading/coursework by easily clicking the figures they want to connect.
                    Our extension will take care of the rest!</li>
